The most valuable type of art is functional art becaused it is used. Sometimes by millions of people daily.
I consider all of my visual design work as art. 

Indeed the most beautiful art I have seen has been some kind of marketing material.
Something somebody has created to help sell something. This somebody is likely still alive and might share more in common with me than someone who created something that sits in a museum.

I do wonder at times if the art we see in museums served another purpose at one point in time.

Music videos, Commercials, Magazine ads, Party Flyers.
This is art. The creators are alive and interact with us every day.
