While on a recent vacation I decided I should contribute to some open-source projects. I resolved to do so as soon as I was able.
Here are some recent contributions.

Considerations:  
Sticking to the BG brand guidelines, encountered some difficulties with the fonts.
Not suitable for displaying numbers.

Considerations:  
My theory, if we get the display of the smart contract data right, 
we are free to do whatever we want with the rest of the UI. The UI for people's money has to be legit though.
Testing this theory, I created some artwork.   

<br/> <br/>
Fitting with the theme, I was inspired by a piece by Leonardo DaVinci. <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenario" target="_blank"><i>Profilo di Capitano Antico</i></a>
 <br/>
I made a quick illustration to see how it would fit with the UI.

Along with the Mercs site, I also created some artwork to plop in. The artwork is based on the vegetables in Mario 2.
